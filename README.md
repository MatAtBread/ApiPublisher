ApiPublisher
============

ApiPublisher is a simple framnework to extend asynchronous func-back signiture calls across over HTTP. Tested clients exist for NodeJS and web-browsers, and a publisher (server) for NodeJS. The goal of ApiPublisher is provide an identical asynchronous API across clients and servers so that dependent routines can execute at any location without modification.

ApiPublisher works with Nodent [https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodent] seamlessly.

ApiPublisher has been in use since November 2013 in production systems.

Full usage details to be documented.
